    "comment": "While I recognize the need to incentivize broader adoption, the treasury plays a critical role in funding transformative projects that keep Cardano competitive and capable of adapting to ever-evolving technological demands and innovations.\n\nHowever, this proposal hinges on the assumption that ADAâ€™s value will increase in the future, rather than relying on its current value, which introduces a significant level of risk. Moreover, the proposal does not mention any treasury control or oversight mechanisms, raising concerns about long-term sustainability and financial stability.\n\nFor these reasons, I find it prudent to abstain until more concrete safeguards and plans are provided to address the risks associated with reducing the treasury cut."

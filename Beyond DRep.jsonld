    "givenName": "Beyond DRep",
    "motivations": "I chose to become a DRep because governance should be about responsibility, not privilege. I have witnessed how power structures shape narratives and decision-making, often excluding those who think differently. My professional and personal journey has been guided by the principles of justice, balance, and ethical leadership. I want to bring these values into Cardano’s governance, ensuring that technology remains a tool for empowerment rather than control. Beyond DRep is about standing for those who believe in decentralization, but also in a more just and inclusive world.",
    "objectives": "Beyond DRep is a commitment to governance that transcends mere representation. My goal is to ensure that Cardano remains a decentralized, inclusive, and ethically-driven ecosystem. I believe in governance that prioritizes fairness, social responsibility, and technological empowerment. As a DRep, I will work to amplify voices that are often unheard, ensuring that decision-making reflects the true diversity of our global community. My focus is not only on blockchain governance but also on fostering a movement where technology serves humanity, not just corporate or centralized interests.",

    "qualifications": "My qualifications stem from a deep commitment to decentralized governance, technology, and community-driven decision-making. I have extensive experience in IT service management, ensuring quality, transparency, and efficiency in complex systems. I have also been actively involved in Cardano’s ecosystem through Project Catalyst, evaluating proposals with fairness and strategic insight. My ability to analyze, communicate, and align decisions with ethical governance makes me a strong representative for those seeking a fair, impactful, and progressive Cardano."
